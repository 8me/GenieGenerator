# Generator
The GENIE Generator product is an advanced physics simulation used by nearly all modern 
neutrino experiments and it plays a key role in the exploitation of neutrino data. 
This product implements a modern software framework for Monte Carlo event generators and 
includes state-of-the-art physics modules for neutrino or charged-lepton interactions with
nucleons or nuclei, and for the simulation of nucleon decay, n-bar oscillation and boosted dark 
matter. It captures the latest results of the GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data 
and includes several tunes that were produced using the proprietary Comparisons and Tuning products. 
The GENIE physics model is universal and comprehensive:  It handles all neutrinos and targets, 
and all processes relevant from MeV to PeV energy scales. The Generator includes several tools 
(flux drivers, detector geometry navigation drivers, specialized event generation apps, event 
reweighting engines) to simulate complex experimental setups in full detail and to support 
generator-related analysis tasks. For more information, visit http://www.genie-mc.org
